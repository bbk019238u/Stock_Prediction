# Stock_Prediction
**Stock_Predictions_AAPL_GOOG_MSFT**: Applied the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to predict stock values for Apple , Microsoft , and Google. <br>
**Stock_Predictions_TATA**: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis of "NSE-Tata-Global-Beverages-Limited" following which I used LSTM to predict the stocks and used Optuna to finetune the hyperparameters of the LSTM. Once the ML/Data Analysis part was done, I made a Dash web application for visualising the stock price data using Plotly and Dash components .
